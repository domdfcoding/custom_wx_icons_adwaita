	The Adwaita Icon Theme.

	:param name: short name of the icon theme, used in e.g. lists when selecting themes.

	:param inherits: The name of the theme that this theme inherits from. If an icon name is not found
		in the current theme, it is searched for in the inherited theme (and recursively in all the
		inherited themes).

		If no theme is specified implementations are required to add the "hicolor" theme to the
		inheritance tree. An implementation may optionally add other default themes in between the last
		specified theme and the hicolor theme.
	:param directories: list of subdirectories for this theme. For every subdirectory there
		must be a section in the index.theme file describing that directory.
	:param scaled_directories: Additional list of subdirectories for this theme, in addition to the ones
		in Directories. These directories should only be read by implementations supporting scaled
		directories and was added to keep compatibility with old implementations that don't support these.
	:param hidden: Whether to hide the theme in a theme selection user interface. This is used for things
		such as fallback-themes that are not supposed to be visible to the user.
	:param example: The name of an icon that should be used as an example of how this theme looks.
